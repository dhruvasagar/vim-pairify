# vim-pairify

A simple plugin for pair completion such as () and []. However, this is
a different take on pair completion instead of auto completing pairs, this
plugin simply puts the cursor between the pair if you happen to type just the
pair, i.e. if you type (), it will put the cursor between the braces and you
can type whatever you want. If however you were completing a pair with already
something within them, the plugin stays out of your way and does nothing.
